        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Benjamin Lee and I am currently a second-year Pre-Business major at the University of California, Riverside. I plan to pursue a career as an Information Systems Manager as I have always had an interest in technology. During this past year, I worked to improve efficiency by 15% at the Finance & Administrative Services Team at UCR as a student assistant. In this position, I was responsible for procurement and administrative support, while learning about data entry. Being my first job in an office setting, I was able to learn so much from this position and my experience as a student assistant is something that will definitely benefit me in my future career path. I have also spent time working as a server in the restaurant industry which taught me a great amount about customer service and communication skills. At my restaurant jobs, I had to learn how to work effectively in a fast paced environment and collaborate with team members to best satisfy the customers. In my senior year of highschool, I had the opportunity to carry out my Eagle Project, which consisted of renovating and creating a garden of 100+ plants at the Nature Preserve in my city. This project allowed me to enhance my mentorship skills as I was in charge of 25+ scouts over the course of the 4 days it took to complete. <br><br>

        During my first year at UCR, I spent time as an intern for the Highlander Business Society where I worked to grow my professionalism and explore future opportunities. Here I was able to enhance various hard skills such as interviews, presentations, networking, and case studies. Along with my intern class, we planned a professional and community service event, leading to a turnout of roughly 50 people for each event. I am currently on board for the Korean American Student Association, where I hold the position of Big Little Chair. As the Big Little Chair, I am responsible for planning all events related to this position and pairing up members during our reveals. I am also expanding my knowledge in softwares such as Python and Excel as I know that these will be valuable skills in the future. I am confident that I can use my experiences and skills to efficiently manage a team and make a positive impact in any company I work at in the future. <br><br>

        In my personal life, some of my favorite things to do include snowboarding, playing basketball, going to the gym, hanging out with friends, watching sports, and cooking. I have always loved physical activities and sports which is why I try to make time for this everyday. As a person, I am always open to trying new things as I am a very open-minded person.
